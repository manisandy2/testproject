This is an example to get the business_location_id of a user's Business Profile.
This is used to create Smart Campaigns, an advertising type in Google Ads.

Prerequisites:
1. Get your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project approved.
Fill out this form:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XTQc-QEjsE7YrgstyJxbFDnwmhUhBFFvpNJBw3VzuuE/viewform  
Find out more information here:
https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/prereqs
2. In that approved project, you need to enable two APIs:
My Business Business Information API. There isn’t a typo; ‘business’ is repeated twice.
My Business Account Management API

        # Use the discovery doc to build two services that we can use to make
        # MyBusiness API (aka Business Profile API) calls, 
        # and authenticate the user so we can access their account
        MyBusinessAccount, flags = sample_tools.init(argv, "mybusinessaccountmanagement", "v1", __doc__, __file__, scope="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage")

        Step 2 - Get the account information using the Account Managment API

        # Build the request to accounts using list method

        Step 3 - Get the business information using the Business Information API
        This example gets the business_location_id, but you can also get more information.

        https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/businessinformation/rest/v1/accounts.locations/list
